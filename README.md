This is based of of these video series (not a much watch, just follow the prerequisite):
1. [Backend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcQwcyyCOmM)
2. [Frontend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAcD5ueqvHQ)



# Prerequisites

## Get a general sense of what's going on:
These are very short and actually use amazon as their main example, so watching them is quite a good idea:
+ [What is backend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG5ikvJ2TKA)
+ [What is frontend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBu54nfzxAQ)

## Required Installations
+ Download [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  + Python packages
    + `pip install pipenv`
+ Download [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
  + ([this](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) might save you some time...).
  + **Leave the 'PG-admin' option CHECKED!!!!!** (just leave all of them checked...)
  + In the second 'check the wanted options' I've checked **every thing** in it's latest version - in 64 bits.  Skip this at your own peril.
+ Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (which will automate api calls from the backend without needing a frontend or even a browser)
